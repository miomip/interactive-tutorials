Variables and Types
-------
In Kotlin there are something called variables, just like in math. <br>
To explain shortly what variables are. They're placeholders for another value, just like x is in math.  

Under here is the most common variables used. <br>
There are more and you can create your own, but these are what's most common.

- `Int` Integers or ints for short are whole numbers without any decimals.
- `Float` Floats are numbers with decimals. The name Float is from how it works, Floating point arithmetic.
- `Char` Characters or chars for short are just single characters/letters.
- `String` Strings are text, the way it work is with an array(list) of chars. The name is from the frase "a string of characters".
- `Boolean` Booleans are either `true` or `false`. The name Boolean comes from the inventor of boolean logic, George Boole.

Kotlin is something called a dynamically typed language. <br>
Which means it sort of just figures out what the variable is supposed to be.

We are going to show both ways of defining a variable. <br> 
One where we tell it what it is, and one where it figures it out.
